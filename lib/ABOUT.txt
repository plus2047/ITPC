== index type ==
index type of std is usually unsigned int.
but:
1. sometimes negative index is possible.
2. it's hard to be used in reverse travel.
3. unsigned can hold bigger number, but int is big enough for container size.
so ALWAYS USE INT for container size & index.

== number ==
be careful to use int for calculate. it's easy to overflow.
